# MovieTime

Movie Time is an android application designed by me.  It shows Top 10 running movies currently. On Click a detail page shows the detail of the movie and add to favourite tage by the user.

On opening the appliation, everytime it fetches the current data and displays it on the start scrren. Whenever, any user clicks on the movie tile, the detail page abut the movie appears showing the information about the movie, like title , short summary, release date, etcetera. The user can add the movie to its favourite section. For the detail, also TMDb API is used.

For using this application, one will have to get the API key from TMDb developers group. After visiting https://www.themoviedb.org/, create an account and get your own API key. Replace it in the above code and use the above application.

I have included the following screenshots of the above application
